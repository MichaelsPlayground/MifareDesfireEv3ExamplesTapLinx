# Mifare DESFire EV3 examples using TapLinx library

This application is using the **TapLinx library from NXP** to get access to a **Mifare DESFire EV3** tag.

### Important note: the app works with tags of type EV3 only (hardcoded). Trying to work with other tag types like EV1, EV2 or Light will fail for all operations !

### How to get the library:
The library is available on NXP's website for free after a registration (only email and password is necessary) and login:
https://www.mifare.net/en/login/.

You need a license string for app (you get it after log-in) - register the app with your individual package name.

### Do I need an additional setup?
Yes, as the library is bundled with **Google Analytics** you need to register the app with your Google account to get a google-services.json file 
for your individual package name. 

## application development status: UNFINISHED
This app is in development so most of the buttons in the main menu won't work or with internal defined values so please **use the app at this time with caution.**
